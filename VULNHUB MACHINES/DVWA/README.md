**Hey there!**

If you've been using the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) from Vulnhub, you might have noticed it's a bit outdated. Good news! The latest release of DVWA is available on GitHub, and it brings improved features and updates for a better practice environment. So the application used in this walkthrough is not the one available on Vulnhub, but a manual setup of the one available on Github.

The entire process of setting up DVWA on windows and linux is uploaded in the SETUP folder.
